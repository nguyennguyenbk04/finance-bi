Finance Analytics Requirements

1. Understand performance by customer, card, and merchant category
Objective: Identify which customers, card types, and merchant categories drive the most financial activity.
Track transaction volume and total spend by day/month/quarter.
Compare spending behavior across card types (credit vs. debit, premium vs. standard).
Analyze merchant categories (MCC) to identify growing/declining industries (e.g., retail, dining, travel).
Monitor geographic distribution of transactions by city/state → detect regional spending trends.

2. Fraud detection and anomaly monitoring
Link transactions with fraud labels to calculate fraud rate per card type, customer segment, and merchant category.
Track suspicious patterns (e.g., high-value withdrawals, rapid repeated transactions, foreign transactions).
Measure time-to-detection for fraud → improve fraud monitoring systems.

3. Customer financial segmentation
Segment customers based on spending behavior, credit score, debt levels, and income.
Identify high-value customers:
Total spending per customer.
Average transaction value.
Long-term credit card usage and repayment history.
Detect at-risk customers with rising debt or frequent credit limit breaches.
Compare demographic factors (age, gender, income) with financial activity.

4. Card portfolio performance analysis
Objective: Measure profitability and effectiveness of different card products.
Analyze card issuance growth (per year, per customer segment).
Track card activity rates (active vs. dormant cards).
Compare credit vs. debit card performance.
Monitor credit limit utilization (ratio of spending vs. card limit).

5. Merchant and MCC insights
Rank merchants by transaction count, revenue contribution, and fraud incidents.
Group MCC codes to analyze industry-level performance (e.g., travel spending vs. retail).
Detect merchant risk categories with high fraud or error rates.

6. Customer lifetime value & retention
Measure repeat transactions vs. one-time transactions.
Track loyalty by analyzing long-term active clients.
Build customer lifetime value (CLV) models based on spend, income, and repayment capacity.
Identify opportunities for cross-selling/upselling (e.g., premium card upgrades).
